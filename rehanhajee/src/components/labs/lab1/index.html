				Hi everyone! My name is Rehan Hajee, and I am a third year Computer Science full-time student at Ryerson University. I am currently 20 years old, and I also have an older sister who is a year older than me. Ever since 10th grade, I have always had a passion for programming, and decided to persue a computer science post-secondary program.
